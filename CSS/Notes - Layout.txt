Layout

Position

you can position any html element with any of four values:
	1. Static (default) Static positioning stacks up elements 
	   one after the other down the page
	   
	2. Relative position moves an element from it's default position 
	   in some direction
	   if you set an elment to relative you can then set the top,right,
	   bottom and left properties shifting it 
	   the positioning is oppisite so putting a top 20px moves element down 20px
	   
	3. Absolute moves an element to specific position relative to the body of the document
	
	4. Fixed is similar to absolute but it's relative to the window not the body
	   this is ideal for taskbars/header bars and footer
	

You can position elements on top of other elements

Floating and Clearing

Floating elements can shift to the left or right of a line and allow elements to flow up beside it 
if theres enough room
