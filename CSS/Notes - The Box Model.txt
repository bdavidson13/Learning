The Box Model

Every Html Element on a webpage will create a box

Div

3 Key box properties 
	- Border
		Most are not visible by default
		Can specify width style and color
	- Padding
		Adds space between border of a box and the content of the box
	- Margin
		Space between box and any adjecent elements
		While padding pushes content inward margin pushes boxes away from other boxes
		When there are multiple adjecent boxes with margins the margins will merge to the largest margin
			ex1: el 1 has bottom margin of 5px directly below it el 2 has top margin of 5px
			     the result is 5px space between them
			ex2: el 1 has bottom margin of 2px and directly below it el 2 has top margin of 7px
				 the result is a 7px space between them
		this only applies to top and bottom
	- You can set the Border, Padding and Margin for each side of a box
	
width
	setting width sets the width of the content of a box
