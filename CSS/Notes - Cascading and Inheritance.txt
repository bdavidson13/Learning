Cascading and Inheritiance

Default Stylesheet
	- Browser style sheet
	- Least weight
User Stylesheet
	- User Defined, but not for site but for your browser
	- More weight than default less than author
Author Stylesheet
	- Your typical CSS file 
	- More weight than User or Default less than inline style
inline styles

When browser sees conflicting rules from same source it goes with last one written
	- this is also true with different style sheets
		Sheet1
			p{
				color:green;
			}
		Sheet2
			p{
				color:grey;
			}
		<html>
			<Head>
				<link rel="stylesheet" href="Sheet2.css" type="text/css">
				<link rel="stylesheet" href="Sheet1.css" type="text/css">
				...
		any pagraph text would be green since Sheet1 was loaded last
	
Specficity can also determine which rule will win out. 
	- Rule with highest specficity wins out
		speficity Ratings A B C	
			C : Count of Type selectors
			B : Count of Class and attribute Selectors
			A : Count of ID selectors
		
		example
		
		  rule 			| A | B | C | Specifiicty Rating
		*(wild card) 	| 0 | 0	| 0 | 		0
		LI 				| 0 | 0 | 1 | 		1
		UL LI 			| 0 | 0 | 2 | 		2
		LI.nav 			| 0 | 1 | 1 |      11
		#content 		| 1 | 0 | 0 | 	  100
		
Specificity winning out only works for rules you set for that selectors

so if you have

#content {
	background-color:green;
}

p{
	background-color:grey;
	font-size: 12pt;
}

<p id="content">This text here </p>

the background color would be green and the font size would be 12 pt.
