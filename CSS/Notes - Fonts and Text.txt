Fonts and Texts

Serif font : has some embellishments 
sans-serif font : no embellishments. (the default text in notepadd ++ is serif)
sans-serif is believed to be easier to read on LCD screens

when createing a rule about font family you can provide as many as you want, comma separated,
and the browser will pick the first one that matches

fonts are inheritted. If you set font on body all the divs, anchors, spans, etc.. will pick it up

Font sizes
	Absolute 
		usually in pixels (px) Gives precise control. doesn't allow scaling (I don't think)
	Relative
		in percentages or em's gives size based on a baseline ex 2em is twice the size of baseline
		relative sizes can scale when zooming in and out
