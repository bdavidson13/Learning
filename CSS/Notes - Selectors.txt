Style Rules

Selector{
propertyname:value;
}

Simple type selector finds simple types like body or div and applies rules to those types

body{
	background-color:#ccccc99;
}

id selector finds all elements with that id and applies rules to elements with that id

#divWidget {
	background-color:#ffffff;
}

class selector finds all elements with that class and applies rules to elements of that class

.nav{
	background-color:green;
}

you can stack rules by giving multiple selectors separated by ,

h1,h2 {
	background-color: blue;
}

Descendant Selectors
they apply more specific element within element ex:

div p {
	background-color:ddddaa;
}

this would change background color of all paragraphs within a div. 
if it was separated by , it would be a stacked selector and would apply to all divs and all paragraphs

Child selectors

a child selector selects element that is a direct child of another element ex:

div > p {
	background-color:green;
}

the differnce between child and descendant is descendant applies to any p within a div where as 
child only applies to a p that is directectly inside.

<div>
	<p> This would be effected by child selectore </p>
	<span>
		<p> this would not be effected by child selector</p>
	<span>
</div>
if you use the Descendant selector both p's would be effected not just the first

Attribute selector
selects elements that have the given attribute with given value ex:

option[selected=true] {
	font:bold;
}

Pseudo-class selector
A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. ex:

div:hover{
	background-color:blue;
}
a:visited{
	background-color:purple;
}
